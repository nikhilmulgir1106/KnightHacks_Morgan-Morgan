Our comprehensive case analysis has identified 3 missing records and found 
1 duplicate document, detected anxious client tone and prepared appropriate 
response, found 2 relevant legal precedents, catalogued 5 pieces of evidence 
(4 verified), noted 1 missing exhibit, scheduled call with Sarah Mitchell.
```

### 3. Recommended Actions (1-2 sentences)

attorney_brief = await generate_attorney_brief(result)
result["attorney_brief"] = attorney_brief
```

### Orchestrator Output

```json

    "summary": "Case #2024-PI-8888...",
    "context_metadata": {...},
    "detected_tasks": [...],
    "agent_outputs": {...},
    "recommended_actions": [...],
    "attorney_brief": "This office represents Emily Watson in Case #2024-PI-8888...",
