LEGAL ISSUES FOR RESEARCH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIMARY LEGAL QUESTIONS:

1. DUTY OF CARE
   What duty does a commercial property owner (grocery store) owe to 
   customers (business invitees) regarding hazardous conditions on the 
   premises?
   
   Specific Issue: Does the store have a duty to inspect for and remedy 
   hazardous conditions created by their own equipment (misting system)?

2. NOTICE AND KNOWLEDGE
   What constitutes "actual notice" vs "constructive notice" of a 
   hazardous condition?
   
   Specific Issue: Store employees testified they knew the misting system 
   sometimes caused water accumulation. Does this establish actual notice?

3. BREACH OF DUTY
   What actions constitute breach of the duty of care in premises liability?
   
   Specific Issue: Failure to place warning signs or barriers around a 
   known hazardous condition.

4. CAUSATION
   What is the standard for establishing causation in slip and fall cases?
   
   Specific Issue: Direct causation between wet floor and client's injuries.

5. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE
   How does California's comparative negligence doctrine apply?
   
   Specific Issue: Defense may argue client should have seen the water.
   Need precedents on what constitutes reasonable care by plaintiff.

6. DAMAGES
   What types of damages are recoverable in premises liability cases?
   
   Specific Issue: Medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering,
   future medical care for ongoing back issues.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RELEVANT FACTS FOR LEGAL ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUPPORTING OUR CASE:
✓ Store's own equipment (misting system) created the hazard
✓ Store employees testified they were aware misting caused water buildup
✓ No warning signs or wet floor cones were present
✓ Store incident report confirms water on floor at time of fall
✓ Security camera footage shows client walking normally before slip
✓ Multiple employees witnessed the incident
✓ Client required emergency medical treatment
✓ Documented injuries: concussion, lumbar strain, ongoing back pain
✓ Client has missed 3 weeks of work (documented lost wages)

DEFENSE ARGUMENTS TO COUNTER:
⚠ Defense claims water was "open and obvious" hazard
⚠ Defense argues client should have exercised more caution
⚠ Defense suggests client may have been distracted by phone
⚠ Defense claims injuries are pre-existing or exaggerated

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
JURISDICTION & APPLICABLE LAW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Jurisdiction: California State Court (Superior Court, San Francisco County)

Applicable Law:
- California Civil Code § 1714 (general negligence duty)
- California premises liability case law
- California comparative negligence doctrine (Li v. Yellow Cab)

Case Type: Tort - Premises Liability - Slip and Fall

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RESEARCH REQUESTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PRIORITY 1 - DUTY OF CARE:
Research California precedents establishing duty of care owed by business
owners to invitees. Need cases specifically addressing:
- Rowland v. Christian (duty to invitees)
- Business owner's duty to maintain safe premises
- Duty regarding hazards created by owner's own equipment/operations

PRIORITY 2 - ACTUAL NOTICE:
Research cases defining "actual notice" of hazardous conditions.
Need precedents showing that employee knowledge = store knowledge.

PRIORITY 3 - FAILURE TO WARN:
Research cases where failure to post warning signs constituted breach.
Need precedents on duty to warn of known hazards.

PRIORITY 4 - COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE:
Research California comparative negligence cases, particularly:
- Li v. Yellow Cab Co. (establishing pure comparative negligence)
- Cases addressing "open and obvious" defense
- Plaintiff's duty to exercise reasonable care

PRIORITY 5 - DAMAGES:
Research cases supporting damages for:
- Pain and suffering in slip and fall cases
- Future medical expenses for ongoing conditions
- Lost earning capacity

DESIRED RESEARCH OUTPUT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For each legal issue, we need:

1. 2-3 relevant California precedents (or federal if applicable)
2. Proper legal citations
3. Summary of each case's holding
4. Explanation of how each case supports our arguments
5. Distinguishing factors from defense precedents
6. Legal reasoning synthesis showing strength of our case

Focus on:
- Recent California Court of Appeal and Supreme Court decisions
- Cases with similar facts (grocery store, wet floor, misting system)
- Landmark premises liability cases
- Cases establishing favorable legal standards

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ATTORNEY NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This is a strong premises liability case. The store created the hazard
through their own equipment, had actual knowledge of the recurring problem,
and failed to take reasonable precautions (warning signs, barriers, or
fixing the misting system).

We need solid legal precedents to:
1. Establish clear duty of care
2. Prove breach through failure to warn
3. Counter the "open and obvious" defense
4. Support our damages claims

The research should focus on California law, particularly cases from the
California Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal. Rowland v. Christian is
our foundational case, but we need more recent precedents with similar
facts.

Client is credible, injuries are well-documented, and liability appears
clear. Strong legal research will help us negotiate a favorable settlement
or prevail at trial.
