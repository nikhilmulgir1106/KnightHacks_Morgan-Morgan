ATTORNEY NOTES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Strong case with comprehensive evidence documentation.
Medical evidence clearly establishes injury and causation.
Multiple witnesses corroborate wet floor and lack of warning signs.
Store's own incident report confirms hazardous condition.

Evidence organization is good but need to:
- Pursue missing surveillance video aggressively
- Complete expert witness retention
- Prepare evidence binders by category for trial
- Create chronological timeline with evidence references

Estimated case value: $35,000-$50,000 based on current evidence.
